## About

This will build a Docker Image for [tinc](https://www.tinc.org/) - A VPN service.

* Latest Release automatically downloaded and compiled (1.1 test series)
* Automatically downloads peer configuration files from git server based on network name.
* Configurable Options for resyncing information from git server
* Configurable Options to enable various types of compression or enable debugging for troubleshooting.
* Logrotate Installed and will rotate logs daily and hold for 7 days.

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

* This image relies on a private Git Repository to store configuration data. Create a private repo and user account in git before proceeding.

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build <arguments> (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/tinc)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofit/docker-tinc:(imagetag)
Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-tinc/pkgs/container/docker-tinc)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-tinc:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Alter Firewall Configuration to allow access to [network ports](#networking)

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory       | Description         |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| `/etc/tinc/`    | Root tinc Directory |
| `/var/log/tinc` | Log Files           |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`, `nano`.

### Networking

The following ports are exposed.

| Port  | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `655` | Tinc        |

> **NOTE**: You must also allow capabilities for `NET_ADMIN` to docker to be able to have access to the IP Stack. Also, you must create `/dev/tun` as a device. If you want to make the Docker Host be able to be accessible you also must add `network:host` as an option otherwise only the containers will be accessible. See the working compose.yml example as shown above.
